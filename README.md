## 💡 The Problem: Enterprise AI is a Black Box

- **Regulators ask**: "Can you prove your AI isn't discriminating? Show us the audit trail."
- **Boards ask**: "How do we know our AI is working correctly? What's our liability exposure?"
- **Customers ask**: "Why should we trust this AI decision? How do we know it's not biased?"

**Without SYMBI, you're flying blind with billions at risk.** EU AI Act fines start at €35M. One biased AI decision can destroy customer trust.

## ⚡ The Solution: Cryptographic Proof for Every AI Decision

SYMBI transforms your AI from a liability risk into a competitive advantage with enterprise-grade trust infrastructure:

- **🔐 Cryptographic Audit Trails** - Every AI interaction gets an immutable receipt
- **⚖️ Real-time Bias Detection** - Continuous fairness monitoring across all models  
- **📊 AI vs Human Performance** - Compare success rates to optimize automation
- **🛡️ Multi-Provider Support** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity with unified governance
- **📋 Compliance Dashboard** - Board-ready reports with proof of compliance

## 🎯 Market Opportunity

- **$62B TAM** in AI trust & compliance infrastructure
- **47% CAGR** driven by regulatory mandates (EU AI Act enforcing 2025)
- **$150K+ ARR** potential per enterprise customer
- **18-month competitive moat** from patent filing (Australia)
