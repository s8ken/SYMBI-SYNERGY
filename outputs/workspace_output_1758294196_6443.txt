okay but you cant review the code
That is correct—the provided file contains only the README and summary documentation, not
the source code itself, so a full code review is not possible based on this information alone. The
README describes the architecture, features, technologies, and repository structure but does
not include the detailed implementation files or code logic required for a technical review. [2]
